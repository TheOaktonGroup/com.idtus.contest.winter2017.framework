-support an optional command line argument that specifies a number of exploratory black-box testing iterations in
 the form of -bbTests<numberOfTestsHere>
-support an optional command line argument that specifies a time test goal in the form of -timeGoal<numberMinsHere>. 
 If the iterations compleate within this time, the solution shall run additional exploratory blac box test 
 iterations.
-print to stdout a YAML report at the end of testing along with an optional command line argument in the form of
 -toolChain that limits the YAML output
-support all the different argument types, such as bounded Strings, doubles, and integers
-make sure the end result is an executable jar with the name com.idtus.contest.winter2017.framework.jar
-deliver solution as a Maven Project in Eclipse with the name com.idtus.winter2017.framework.zip


-need to figure out how to get the tests to cover more code and find more exceptions
	-intelligent paraneter choosing, based on previous imputs
	-might need to the change the ParameterFactory class: don't know why, but they think we do
-do we need different Test types? Surely a single Test class can't cover all the different tests. For that matter,
 why isn't the Test class used in the example secure test method? I feel like they expect us to expand and use the
 class a lot.
